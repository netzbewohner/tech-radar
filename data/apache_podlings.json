Experienced users can use programming languages such as Python, R, Java, and Scala to implement customized computation logic. The platform allows users to pause the execution of a workflow to investigate the operator states, and resume the execution at a later time. The platform can be used by a research community to publish valuable resources such as data sets, workflows, and ML models to share their domain-specific knowledge and support reproducibility of scientific research.
